Build a modular and scalable code using classes and objects 
This repository demonstrates how to build **modular and scalable programs** in Python using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

Core Concepts Covered
**Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details using private and protected members.
**Abstraction**: Using abstract base classes to define interfaces.
**Inheritance**: Creating hierarchies of classes to reuse code.
**Polymorphism**: Designing classes that share a common interface but behave differently.

Why Modular and Scalable Code?
**Modular** code separates logic into independent files or components.
**Scalable** code allows easy extension without modifying existing logic.
- OOP helps organize complex programs by grouping data and behavior.
